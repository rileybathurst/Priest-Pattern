// I probably need something here that's on the color spectrum
// to be above 3 when dark it's pretty close to black #003E57 or near to that 1.72 from black
// lightness above 3 is very close to white #DBF5FF

// I think I need

- dark - secondary font (lighter)
- primary - link
- secondary - hover (darker)

// a primary and secondary background I can run
- white - primary
- light - secondary
- how am I doing links here?
// I've looked into other colors at times but never been approved
// in light mode links should go darker // in dark mode links go lighter
// we cant have a deep enough blue to have to have normal primary as a link

/* here is what I need to test
// we might be able to have a pretty light blue that goes dark and still hits the 4.5.
// dark mode it would be a very dark blue on the blue so it's almost black and then get's lighter?
// I just don't think I can get the color to link 3.0 with the 4.5 that's just too tight a needle to thread.

// with this still a blue link on blue maybe I have to do something differnt with the text color
// I think that should always be monochromatic tho so I don't have many options.

// a flip for dark mode of secondary and primary
// a black and dark I can run
- white - primary
- light - secondary (darker)
- primary - link
- secondary - hover (lighter)

// so far I have no specific use of medium it's a nice to have but I should know where it can go
// how often am I using a third in just text color or is it design elements like borders etc

// colors come in triples with a base and a hover state darker for light mode, lighter for dark mode.
// this is kinda what I was doing with a darken 10% but that was also messy and guess and check in lots of places
// this way I am confirming contrast ratios etc
